# Node.js App Periodic Deployment with Jenkins CI/CD

This repository contains an example Node.js application along with a Jenkins pipeline configuration for setting up a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) process with periodic deployments.

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to automate the build, test, and deployment of a Node.js application using Jenkins. The Jenkins pipeline is configured to perform periodic builds and deployments, ensuring that the latest changes are regularly deployed to the target environment.

## Features

- Automated build, test, and deployment of a Node.js application
- Jenkins pipeline with stages for cloning, building, testing, and deploying the application
- Periodic build triggered by a cron schedule (daily at midnight)
- Automatic deployment to a target server using NGINX
- Example Node.js application for demonstration purposes

## Prerequisites

To use this project, ensure you have the following:

- Node.js and npm installed on the target server for running the application
- Jenkins installed and configured to execute pipeline jobs
- NGINX installed on the target server for hosting the deployed application

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Modify the Jenkins pipeline script (`Jenkinsfile`) to customize the build, test, and deployment steps according to your application and deployment requirements.
3. Create a Jenkins job, specifying this repository as the source.
4. Configure the Jenkins job to run the pipeline using the provided Jenkinsfile.
5. Set up the necessary environment variables or configuration files for your deployment server and application.
6. Run the Jenkins job, and the pipeline will automatically clone the repository, build, test, and deploy the application to the specified target server.

Note: Make sure to update the repository URL, target server information, and deployment steps in the Jenkinsfile according to your specific setup.
